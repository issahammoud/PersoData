<h1>Detect Fake Paintings</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by the ChaLearn</h3>
<p>This is a sample starting kit for the Persodata challenge. It uses paintings from WikiArt (the Visual Art Encyclopedia). 
The data here was preprocessed (resizing and feature extraction).
Half of the images in this data set are fake paintings which were generated through Generative Adversarial Network. 
The task for this challenge is a binary classification whose goal is to detect the fake paintings.</p>
